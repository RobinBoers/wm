    This is a micro service that will check a given URL for links to other sites,
    discover if those links support webmentions and will send a webmention POST
    to the target.

    The API is simplistic for now:

    - https://wm.isthe.link/check/:url - performs a dry run, showing what will be sent
    - https://wm.isthe.link/check/:url&doSend=1 - sends the webmention requests
