            <h1>About webmention.app</h1>
            <p>
              <a href="https://remysharp.com">Remy Sharp</a> wrote webmention.app because it seemed like webmention notification systems were thin on the ground and wanted to use a notification system that was agnostic of the blogger's software.
            </p>
            <p>The service is currently free, and will remain so, as it is able to run one a single server with little to zero maintenance (monitoring to be added).</p>
            <p>
              Still want to say thanks or support the project?
