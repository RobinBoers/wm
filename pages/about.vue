# About webmention.app

[Remy Sharp](https://remysharp.com) wrote webmention.app because it seemed like webmention notification systems were thin on the ground, and wanted to use a notification system that was agnostic of the user software.

The service is currently free, and will remain so, as it is able to run one a single server with little to zero maintenance.

Still want to say thanks or support the project? **[You can buy (some) drinks](https://www.paypal.me/rem/usd) ❤️**
