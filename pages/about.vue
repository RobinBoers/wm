    <h1>About webmention.app</h1>
    <p>
      <a href="https://remysharp.com">Remy Sharp</a> wrote webmention.app because it seemed like webmention notification systems were thin on the ground, and wanted to use a notification system that was agnostic of the user software.
    </p>
    <p>The service is currently free, and will remain so, as it is able to run one a single server with little to zero maintenance (monitoring to be added).</p>
    <p>
      Still want to say thanks or support the project?
